# Online-shopping-system
Design a detailed class diagram for an online shopping system that supports user registration, login, and 
profile management, with two types of users: customers and admins. Customers should be able to browse 
products by category, add items to a shopping cart, place orders, and make payments using multiple methods 
(credit card, UPI, wallet). The system must handle product inventory, multiple shipping addresses, discounts, 
order tracking, and allow customers to rate and review products. Use appropriate object-oriented concepts 
such as inheritance (for user and payment types), aggregation (cart with items), and composition (order with 
order items), and include multiplicities and relationships among classes. 
OVERVIEW: 
This class diagram represents the structure of an online shopping system using object-oriented principles 
such as inheritance, aggregation, and association. It defines the major entities (classes), their attributes, 
and the relationships among them. The system supports user registration, product management, cart 
and order processing, discounts, shipping, and multiple payment methods.
